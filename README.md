# i-scare-explosions
A plugin which prevents block destruction from explosions caused by ghast/creepers in Minecraft.

## Motivation
I have disabled game rule `mobGriefing` because I scare explosions,
but it has other side effects such as villagers cannot farm.
So I needed something alternative, which is this plugin.

## Note
This plugin does not prevent explosions caused by
- Withers - because they will be spawned manually by player.
- Ender Crystals - because (in most cases) they will explode under control.
